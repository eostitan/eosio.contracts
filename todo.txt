# producer_info table reversion
- add total_votes = 0;
- rename:
    uint64_t              produced_blocks = 0;
    uint32_t              unpaid_blocks = 0;
+ double   by_votes()const    { return is_active ? -total_votes : total_votes;  }
+ remove by_location index

### revised registration workflow
- addprod --- reserve and primary (worbli)
   - insert into producers table
   - set active = N
- promote to active (worbli, prerequisite=add to producers)
   - set active = Y
- regprod (producer, prerequisite= active=Y)
   - set key, URL, location 
- unregprod (producer)
   - unset key
- demote from active (worbli)
   - unset key, set active=N
- remove producer (worbli)
   - delete from produce
